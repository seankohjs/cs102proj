■
SEQUENCE OF PLAY
- Play a Card:
    On your turn, select any card from your hand and place it at the end of the parade.

- Counting Phase:
    Immediately after playing your card, count backwards from the end of the parade using the Value of the card you played.
    
-Determine Removal Eligibility:
  If the count reaches the beginning of the parade, (i.e. all cards are counted), no cards are eligible for removal and your turn ends.
  Otherwise, the cards that were not counted become eligible for removal.

-Removal Phase:
  You may remove up to two cards that meet the following eligible criteria
    The first removal is any card that has a number less than the number on the card you played.
    The second removal is any card that is of the same suit as the card you played.
  The removed cards are added to your collection.
■
DRAW PHASE
-If it is not the final round, after your turn you draw one card from the draw pile, and your hand is adjusted according to the game’s rules.
■
ENDING THE GAME
 - The game enters the final round when either:
     1. A player collects cards of all 6 colors
     - OR - 
     2. The draw pile is exhausted.

 - In the final round, players do not draw any cards after playing.

 - Once the final round is complete, (i.e. every player gets one last turn), the game ends.
■
SCORING
 - Each player’s score is calculated Color by Color.

   For each Color:
     - If a player has the majority of cards in that color, each card counts as 1 point.
     - In two-player games, a majority is defined as having at least 2 more cards than the opponent. 
     - Otherwise, the cards are scored by summing their face values.

 - The overall score is the sum of all color scores.

 - The player with the lowest total score wins.

 - In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest collected cards wins.
■
ADDITIONAL NOTES
 - During the game, after each turn, you will see your current collection and hand, as well as 
   other players' collections, to help you plan your moves.
