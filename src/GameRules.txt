--- Game Rules ---

Parade is a card game for 2 to 6 players where the goal is to score as few points as possible.

Game Components:
 - 66 cards in 6 colors (for example: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, and Grey).
 - Each card has a value ranging from 0 to 10.
 - A score pad for tracking points.

Setup:
 1. The starting player is determined randomly.
 2. The deck is shuffled.
 3. Each player is dealt 5 cards.
 4. 6 cards are dealt face up in a row to form the initial "parade".
 5. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

Sequence of Play:
 - On your turn, select one card from your hand and play it at the end of the parade.
 - After playing a card, if the number of cards in the parade exceeds the value of the card played,
   a "removal phase" is triggered. In this phase, a group of cards (the "removal mode") is identified.
 - From these cards, any card that has the same color as the played card or any card with a value
   less than or equal to the played card is eligible to be removed and added to your collection.
 - If no card qualifies for removal, nothing is collected.
 - If it is not the final round, after your turn you draw one card from the draw pile,
   and your hand is adjusted (discarding excess cards if needed).

Ending the Game:
 - The game enters the final round when either:
     a) A player collects cards of all 6 colors, OR
     b) The draw pile is exhausted.
 - In the final round, players do not draw any cards after playing.
 - Once the final round is complete (every player gets one last turn), the game ends.

Scoring:
 - Each playerâ€™s score is calculated color by color.
   For each color:
     - If a player has the majority of cards in that color, each card counts as 1 point.
     - Otherwise, the face values on the cards of that color are summed.
 - The overall score is the sum of all color scores.
 - The player with the lowest total score wins.
 - In case of a tie, the player with the fewest collected cards wins.

Additional Notes:
 - During the game, after each turn, you will see your current collection and hand, as well as 
   other players' collections, to help you plan your moves.
 - A menu is provided at the start so you can choose to play the game, view these rules, or quit.
