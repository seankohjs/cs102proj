--- Game Rules ---

Parade is a card game for 2 to 6 players where the goal is to score as few points as possible.

Game Components:
 - 66 cards in 6 colors (for example: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, and Grey).
 - Each card has a value ranging from 0 to 10.
 - A score pad for tracking points.

Setup:
 1. The starting player is determined randomly.
 2. The deck is shuffled.
 3. Each player is dealt 5 cards.
 4. 6 cards are dealt face up in a row to form the initial "parade".
 5. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

Sequence of Play:
- Play a Card:
    On your turn, select any card from your hand and play it at the end of the parade.
- Counting Phase:
    Immediately after playing your card, count backwards from the end of the parade using the number printed on the card you played.
-Determine Removal Eligibility:
  -If the count reaches the beginning of the parade (i.e., all cards are counted), no cards are eligible for removal and your turn ends.
  -Otherwise, the cards that were not counted become eligible for removal.
-Removal Phase:
  -You may remove up to two cards from the eligible group:
  -The first removal is any card that has a number less than the number on the card you played.
  -The second removal is any card that is of the same suit as the card you played.
  -Removed cards are added to your collection.

Draw Phase:
-If it is not the final round, after your turn you draw one card from the draw pile, and your hand is adjusted according to the game’s rules.

Ending the Game:
 - The game enters the final round when either:
     a) A player collects cards of all 6 colors, OR
     b) The draw pile is exhausted.
 - In the final round, players do not draw any cards after playing.
 - Once the final round is complete (every player gets one last turn), the game ends.

Scoring:
 - Each player’s score is calculated color by color.
   For each color:
     - If a player has the majority of cards in that color, each card counts as 1 point.
     - In two-player games, a majority is defined as having at least 2 more cards than the opponent. 
     - Otherwise, the cards are scored by summing their face values.
 - The overall score is the sum of all color scores.
 - The player with the lowest total score wins.
 - In case of a tie, the player with the fewest collected cards wins.

Additional Notes:
 - During the game, after each turn, you will see your current collection and hand, as well as 
   other players' collections, to help you plan your moves.
 - A menu is provided at the start so you can choose to play the game, view these rules, or quit.
